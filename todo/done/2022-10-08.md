# `new-operation`

✅ Add `new-operation` template for `ui-es5` component

✅ Add `monorepo` template as well, and use it through this

✅ Call it `new-template`

❌ Templates be put in a `Template`[] and can have a function `canExecuteFrom(absoluteFolderPath)`. Can be nice for creating UI for adding templates. **Cool idea, but cli is fine for now...**
